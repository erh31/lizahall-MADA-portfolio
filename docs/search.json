    "text": "The folders inside this folder should contain all data at various stages.\nThis data is being loaded/manipulated/changed/saved with code from the code folders.\nYou should place the raw data in the raw_data folder and not edit it. Ever!\nIdeally, load the raw data into R and do all changes there with code, so everything is automatically reproducible and documented.\nSometimes, you need to edit the files in the format you got. For instance, Excel files are sometimes so poorly formatted that it’s close to impossible to read them into R, or the persons you got the data from used color to code some information, which of course won’t import into R. In those cases, you might have to make modifications in a software other than R. If you need to make edits in whatever format you got the data (e.g. Excel), make a copy and place those copies in a separate folder, AND ONLY EDIT THOSE COPIES. Also, write down somewhere the edits you made.\nAdd as many sub-folders as suitable. If you only have a single processing step, one sub-folder for processed data is enough. If you have multiple stages of cleaning and processing, additional sub-folders might be useful. Adjust based on the complexity of your project.\nI suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data:\nhttp://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata"

    "text": "This Quarto file loads the cleaned data and does some exploring.\nI’m only showing it the way where the code is included in the file. As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nhere() starts at /Users/lizahall/Desktop/School/Spring 2024/Applied Data Analysis/GitHub/lizahall-MADA-portfolio\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nLoad the data.\n\n#Path to data.

The dataset provides information on contagious diseases in the U.S. by state, year, and disease. There are six variables in the dataset: disease, state, year, weeks reporting, count, and population.\nPart 1 - Loading and Checking Data\n\n#Load the required packages\nlibrary(dslabs)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n#Look at help file for \"us_contagious_diseases\"\nhelp(us_contagious_diseases)\n\n#Get an overview of data structure\nstr(us_contagious_diseases)\n\n'data.frame':   16065 obs. of  6 variables:\n $ disease        : Factor w/ 7 levels \"Hepatitis A\",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ state          : Factor w/ 51 levels \"Alabama\",\"Alaska\",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ year           : num  1966 1967 1968 1969 1970 ...\n $ weeks_reporting: num  50 49 52 49 51 51 45 45 45 46 ...\n $ count          : num  321 291 314 380 413 378 342 467 244 286 ...\n $ population     : num  3345787 3364130 3386068 3412450 3444165 ...\n\n#Get a summary of data\nsummary(us_contagious_diseases)\n\n        disease            state            year      weeks_reporting\n Hepatitis A:2346   Alabama   :  315   Min.   :1928   Min.   : 0.00  \n Measles    :3825   Alaska    :  315   1st Qu.:1950   1st Qu.:31.00  \n Mumps      :1785   Arizona   :  315   Median :1975   Median :46.00  \n Pertussis  :2856   Arkansas  :  315   Mean   :1971   Mean   :37.38  \n Polio      :2091   California:  315   3rd Qu.:1990   3rd Qu.:50.00  \n Rubella    :1887   Colorado  :  315   Max.   :2011   Max.   :52.00  \n Smallpox   :1275   (Other)   :14175                                 \n     count          population      \n Min.   :     0   Min.   :   86853  \n 1st Qu.:     7   1st Qu.: 1018755  \n Median :    69   Median : 2749249  \n Mean   :  1492   Mean   : 4107584  \n 3rd Qu.:   525   3rd Qu.: 4996229  \n Max.   :132342   Max.   :37607525  \n                  NA's   :214       \n\n#Determine the type of object \"us_contagious_diseases\" is\nclass(us_contagious_diseases)\n\n[1] \"data.frame\"\n\n\nPart 2 -

Here are some of the prompts and responses:\nI asked the AI to help me recreate the original graph:\n\nInput:\n\nCan you help me to recreate this graph using R code? I’ve got the data and can provide more information about the dataset as needed. (Attached graph image)\n\n\n\nChatGPT:\n\nAbsolutely, I can help you recreate this graph using R. Could you please provide the dataset or the data points you have? Once I have the data, I can write and run the R code to generate a similar bar chart.\n\n\n\nInput:\n\n(Attached dataset ‘elements-by-episode.csv’)\n\nCode generated by the AI, first attempt:\n# Loading required libraries\nlibrary(here) \nlibrary(dplyr)  \nlibrary(ggplot2) \nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\n\n# Print the resolved file path\nprint(here(\"presentation-exercise\", \"elements-by-episode.csv\"))\n[1] “/Users/lizahall/Desktop/School/Spring 2024/Applied Data Analysis/GitHub/lizahall-MADA-portfolio/presentation-exercise/elements-by-episode.csv”\n# Load the data\ndata &lt;- read_csv(\"../presentation-exercise/elements-by-episode.csv\")\n\n# Calculate the percentage of episodes containing each element\npercentages &lt;- colSums(data[,-(1:2)]) / nrow(data) * 100\n\n# Create a data frame for plotting\nplot_data &lt;- data.frame(Element = names(percentages), Percentage = percentages) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(Percentage))\n\n# Plot the data using ggplot2\nggplot(plot_data, aes(x = reorder(Element, -Percentage), y = Percentage)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  coord_flip() +  # Flip the coordinates to make a horizontal bar chart\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"The Paintings of Bob Ross\",\n       subtitle = \"Percentage containing each element\",\n       x = \"\",\n       y = \"Percentage\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.05))) # Add a little space at the end of bars\n\nChatGPT seemed to have a lot of trouble with this one. Since the data had been manually grouped and not all of the variables were included it seemed to struggle to generate code that reproduced the results of the graph. However it did do a fairly good job capturing the general formatting after some more specific prompting.\n\n\nInput:\n\nCan you make the bars light blue, and also have the highest percentages on the top?\n\n\n\nChatGPT:\n\nCertainly! To make the bars light blue, you can specify the fill argument inside the geom_bar() function. Since the data is already sorted in descending order from the previous code, the highest percentages will be on the top. Here is the updated R code with these adjustments:\n\nCode generated by the AI, second attempt:\n# Load the data\ndata &lt;- read_csv(here(\"presentation-exercise\", \"elements-by-episode.csv\"))\n\n# Calculate the percentage of episodes containing each element\npercentages &lt;- colSums(data[,-(1:2)]) / nrow(data) * 100\n\n# Create a data frame for plotting\nplot_data &lt;- data.frame(Element = names(percentages), Percentage = percentages) %&gt;%\n  arrange(Percentage) # Sort in ascending order for correct plotting after coord_flip()\n\n# Plot the data using ggplot2 with light blue bars and correct order\nggplot(plot_data, aes(x = reorder(Element, Percentage), y = Percentage)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"lightblue\") +\n  coord_flip() +  # Flip the coordinates to make a horizontal bar chart\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"The Paintings of Bob Ross\",\n       subtitle = \"Percentage containing each element\",\n       x = \"\",\n       y = \"Percentage\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.05))) # Add a little space at the end of bars\n\nWhile closer, it was still pretty far from the original graph.

    "text": "This Quarto file loads the cleaned data and does some exploring.\nI’m only showing it the way where the code is included in the file. As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nhere() starts at /Users/lizahall/Desktop/School/Spring 2024/Applied Data Analysis/GitHub/lizahall-MADA-portfolio\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nLoad the data.\n\n#Path to data.

As long as you can see what’s going on, there is no need to polish them. That’s in contrast to figures you’ll produce for your final products (paper, report, presentation, website, etc.). Those should look as nice, polished and easy to understand as possible."

Does that mean it should be a numeric 60? It somehow doesn’t make sense since the weight is 60kg, which can’t happen for a 60cm person (a baby). Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric. That conversion to character also means that our summary function isn’t very meaningful.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

Does that mean it should be a numeric 60? It somehow doesn’t make sense since the weight is 60kg, which can’t happen for a 60cm person (a baby). Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric. That conversion to character also means that our summary function isn’t very meaningful.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

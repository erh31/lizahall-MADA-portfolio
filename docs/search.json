    "text": "The folders inside this folder should contain all data at various stages.\nThis data is being loaded/manipulated/changed/saved with code from the code folders.\nYou should place the raw data in the raw_data folder and not edit it. Ever!\nIdeally, load the raw data into R and do all changes there with code, so everything is automatically reproducible and documented.\nSometimes, you need to edit the files in the format you got. For instance, Excel files are sometimes so poorly formatted that it’s close to impossible to read them into R, or the persons you got the data from used color to code some information, which of course won’t import into R. In those cases, you might have to make modifications in a software other than R. If you need to make edits in whatever format you got the data (e.g. Excel), make a copy and place those copies in a separate folder, AND ONLY EDIT THOSE COPIES. Also, write down somewhere the edits you made.\nAdd as many sub-folders as suitable. If you only have a single processing step, one sub-folder for processed data is enough. If you have multiple stages of cleaning and processing, additional sub-folders might be useful. Adjust based on the complexity of your project.\nI suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data:\nhttp://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata"

    "text": "This Quarto file loads the cleaned data and does some exploring.\nI’m only showing it the way where the code is included in the file. As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nhere() starts at /Users/lizahall/Desktop/School/Spring 2024/Applied Data Analysis/GitHub/lizahall-MADA-portfolio\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nLoad the data.\n\n#Path to data.

I’m not currently conducting any research, but I’m interested in forensics, microbiology, and infectious disease.\n\n\n\nExperience\nI am somewhat familiar with programming and data analysis. While my knowledge is far from extensive, I have encountered procedural and object based coding languages, and various forms of data analysis in my studies thus far. In this course I am hoping to add to and refine my current skill set in programming and data analysis.\n\n\n\nInterests & Fun Facts\nMy other interests include music, art, cooking, and Star Trek.

However, there is a noticeable break in the data, and there seems to be no correlation between population and count after that point. This is because no data is available for the years 1956-1973.\nPart 4 - More Data Processing\n\n#Create a new object by extracting only the data for the years after 1973 from \"georgia\"\ngeorgia3 &lt;- georgia[(georgia$year &gt;= 1974),]\n\n\n#Get an overview of data structure and data summary for \"africadata3\"\nstr(georgia3)\n\n'data.frame':   38 obs. of  6 variables:\n $ disease        : Factor w/ 7 levels \"Hepatitis A\",..: 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 ...\n $ state          : Factor w/ 51 levels \"Alabama\",\"Alaska\",..: 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 ...\n $ year           : num  1974 1975 1976 1977 1978 ...\n $ weeks_reporting: num  6 7 2 19 33 29 40 27 22 48 ...\n $ count          : num  10 8 2 139 75 81 121 57 39 59 ...\n $ population     : num  4920562 5009127 5099141 5190101 5281471 ...\n\nsummary(georgia3)\n\n        disease          state         year      weeks_reporting\n Hepatitis A: 0   Georgia   :38   Min.   :1974   Min.   : 2.00  \n Measles    : 0   Alabama   : 0   1st Qu.:1983   1st Qu.:34.75  \n Mumps      : 0   Alaska    : 0   Median :1992   Median :42.50  \n Pertussis  :38   Arizona   : 0   Mean   :1992   Mean   :38.45  \n Polio      : 0   Arkansas  : 0   3rd Qu.:2002   3rd Qu.:47.75  \n Rubella    : 0   California: 0   Max.   :2011   Max.   :51.00  \n Smallpox   : 0   (Other)   : 0                                 \n     count          population     \n Min.   :  2.00   Min.   :4920562  \n 1st Qu.: 23.00   1st Qu.:5753480  \n Median : 40.00   Median :6852235  \n Mean   : 49.87   Mean   :7111873  \n 3rd Qu.: 58.50   3rd Qu.:8480435  \n Max.   :146.00   Max.   :9830160  \n                                   \n\n\nPart 5 - More Plotting\n\n#Plot count as a function of year for the years after 1973\nggplot(georgia3, aes(x = year, y = count)) + geom_point() + ggtitle(\"Total Number of Reported Cases of Pertussis in Georgia by Year After 1973\")\n\n\n\n\nThere is no noticeable correlation between year and count after 1973.\n\n#Plot count as a function of population for the years after 1973\nggplot(georgia3, aes(x = log(population), y = count)) + geom_point() + ggtitle(\"Total Number of Reported Cases of Pertussis in Georgia by Population After 1973\")\n\n\n\n\nThere is no noticeable correlation between population and count after 1973.\nPart 6 - Simple Model Fits\n\n#Fit count as the outcome and year as the predictor\nfit1 &lt;- glm(count ~ year, data = georgia3, family = poisson(link = \"log\"))\nsummary(fit1)\n\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = count ~ year, family = poisson(link = \"log\"), data = georgia3)\n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

It somehow doesn't make sense since the weight is 60kg, which can't happen for a 60cm person (a baby).\nSince we don't know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person.

Document somewhere what inputs each script takes and where output is placed.\nIf scripts need to be run in a specific order, document this.

    "text": "This Quarto file loads the cleaned data and does some exploring.\nI’m only showing it the way where the code is included in the file. As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nhere() starts at /Users/lizahall/Desktop/School/Spring 2024/Applied Data Analysis/GitHub/lizahall-MADA-portfolio\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nLoad the data.\n\n#Path to data.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

For instance you could create a folder for figures, another for tables. Or you could create a sub-folder for dataset 1, another for dataset 2. Or you could have a subfolder for exploratory analysis, another for final analysis. The options are endless, choose whatever makes sense for your project. For this template, there is just a a single folder, but having sub-folders is often a good idea."

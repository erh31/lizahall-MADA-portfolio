### Background

I'm Liza and I'm a first year non-thesis MS student in Bioinformatics. I earned my bachelor's degree in Biology from Georgia Southern University in 2023. I'm not currently conducting any research, but I'm interested in forensics, microbiology, and infectious disease.

### Experience

I am somewhat familiar with programming and data analysis. While my knowledge is far from extensive, I have encountered procedural and object based coding languages, and various forms of data analysis in my studies thus far. In this course I am hoping to add to and refine my current skill set in programming and data analysis.
